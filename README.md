### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an options quant / former machine learning researcher on a trading floor. My coding background is all Python, so I'm working on building out my C++ knowledge! 

Ask me about math or coding or dogs, or how I hope to bring banks out of the stone age. 

You can reach me at fireseine@gmail.com, or feel free to find me on Linkedin.
